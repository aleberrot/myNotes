# 📝 My notes app

This is a basic notes application using Python, Flask and Bootstap. I uses a *database* for storing the data from the users and the user's notes

### **Executing the app**

1. Install everything on the requirements.txt
~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

2. Run the app
~~~
python3 main.py
~~~

And that's it, enjoy 😄!
